# Secret Number Game

This project was developed in **Java** as part of my learning journey in software development.  
It’s a simple console-based game where the player must guess a **randomly generated secret number** within a limited number of attempts.  
The program provides hints after each guess, indicating whether the secret number is higher or lower.

## About the Project

The main goal of this project is to practice fundamental programming concepts, such as:
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Random number generation
- User input handling

The game logic challenges the player to think strategically and improves logical reasoning while coding.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Scanner** (to handle user input)
- **Random** (to generate the secret number)
